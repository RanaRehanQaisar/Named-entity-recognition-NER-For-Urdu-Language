# Named-entity-recognition-NER-For-Urdu-Language
Named Entity Recognition (NER), in this study, we investigate the use of NER using a neural network-based method, which entails training a model to anticipate the named entity tag for each word in a given sentence in Urdu. In order to preprocess the data, we first separate out
the unique words and tags, map them to number indices, and then turn the preprocessed data into
numerical sequences. We then use the preprocessed data to train a neural network model, and we
assess the modelâ€™s performance using a test set. Our findings confirm its efficacy.
